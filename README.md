5 README.mds links
  project1-simulator-multiply-team2, project-3---pipelining-team-2 and project-4---cache-team-2 I had to remake the repositories as the other were set to private, so the readmes
  were unable to be seen.
  
 -https://github.com/MichaelKohorst/koho1134.github.io/blob/main/README.md : This was a project I made in a web development class. The project was an intro in the basics of creating a website. Trying to style it and have a navigation bar.
 
 -https://github.com/gudo1013/webdevproject3/blob/main/README.md : This was the final project I made with a two others in a web development class. This project was a more in depth at an attempt to create a dynamic web site. So within this website it contain a map of St. Paul MN and the crimes that happened. This map and the table with it will dynamically change based on filers.
 
 -https://github.com/MichaelKohorst/project1-simulator-multiply-team2/blob/main/project1-simulator-multiply-team2/simulator/README.md : This was the first project I made with two others in a class about computer architecture. This project was a example of how a computer will take computer language and run it. So it simulator of running computer language.
 
 -https://github.com/MichaelKohorst/project-3---pipelining-team-2/blob/main/README.md : This was a project I made with one other in a class about computer architecture. This project was an attempt to show how pipeline with increase the efficiency of a computer language simulator. The pipelining would run multiple codes of machine language instead of waiting for one to complete.
 
 -https://github.com/MichaelKohorst/project-4---cache-team-2/blob/main/README.md : This was a project I made with one other in a class about computer architecture. This project is an attempt to show how cache with a computer works. Showing off the cache system and how certain data is added and when other data is removed from the cache.
 
Reflection: 

  During my time at St. Thomas my skills as a computer scientist have greatly expanded. I have learn more about the basic languages like, c, python and java. I have also learned more about subject fields within computer science. I have learned about AI, web development, computer architechure, information security and far more. For example my time working on the dynamic web page from web development was a real eye opener for me. It really helped me understand how to create a dynamic web page and what it entail. Using web frameworks to make dynamic pages like Vue.js and querying database to total in a page that has a map of crime from the database and will update according to certain filters.
